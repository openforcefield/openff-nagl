    "First, we need a neural network to train! The neural network is called a \"model\", because once trained it amounts to a statistical model of some aspect of reality - in this case, a mapping from a molecule to a list of partial charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAGL's models start by defining a format to describe a molecule. General purpose formats that work well for humans, like SMILES strings or Kekule structures, tend not to work for AI. Humans have a huge amount of background knowledge; we can read letters, we can interpret visual images, and those of us that can read SMILES strings and Kekule structures know a lot about chemistry too. An untrained neural network doesn't know any of this, and a neural network big enough to learn it would take forever to train and might find it easier to just memorize the partial charges of the molecules in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we want to use our human background knowledge to give the neural network as much relevant information as we can, so it can learn to generalize from the training set rather than memorize it. This is often the great challenge in training neural networks: Giving the network just the right information and abilities to glean a relationship from the training data. Too much and it can invent relationships that don't exist in reality but allow it to reproduce the training set slightly better; too little and it can't learn anything at all. This is also why it's important to separate the test, training and validation datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "In a graph neural network, we describe a molecule as a *graph* of atoms. In mathematics, a graph is a collection of *nodes* that are connected by *edges*. Lots of everyday systems and objects are easy to describe as graphs: in public transit maps, nodes are stops and edges are routes; in geometric shapes, nodes are vertices and edges are, well, edges; on Twitter, nodes are people and edges are follows (or tweets or likes or all of the above!). In a molecular graph, nodes are atoms and edges are bonds. This allows us to apply computational science techniques developed for graphs to molecules. More on that later!\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe a graph, we first need to describe its nodes and edges. Then we can do some magic to turn it into a graph. The format we use to describe nodes and edges is a list of numbers that each describe a particular *feature* of the thing, so the construction of this format is called *featurization*. This lets us choose exactly what information the network has access to, and it lets us use our chemical background knowledge to provide the network with theoretical information that would help it make its decision, but would be too complicated to learn in training. In this example, this includes features like connectivity and ring size, even though that information is redundant with the graph itself; it turns out that having this information \"close to hand\" helps the neural network out!\n",
    "\n",
    "In NAGL, we construct a featurization for atoms by choosing a list of features from those in the [`features.atoms`] module, and for bonds by choosing a list of features from the [`features.bonds`] module. Once it has the featurization, NAGL can apply it to a molecule automatically. A lot of these features are useless in a dataset of acyclic alkanes, but we include them to demonstrate the sorts of features that are available:\n",

    "In addition to the description of the molecule, we also need to specify the architecture of the GNN. NAGL's GNNs consist of two modules, each of which is a neural network: Convolution, which incorporates information about its surroundings into the representation of each atom; and Readout, which computes some chemical property or properties from the convolved representation of an atom. Once the Readout module makes its prediction, a final post-processing layer can be applied to inject some human chemical knowledge on the output end; in the case of partial charges, the readout neural network predicts hardness and electronegativity, and charges are [computed analytically](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci034148o) from them.\n",

    "The GNN model should be configured via a `ModelConfig` object, with convolution and readout layers individually specified. This can be done in Python as specified below, although typically we expect to read from a YAML or JSON file (e.g. `ModelConfig.from_yaml_file` or `ModelConfig.parse_file`).\n",

Note that these hidden layers include the output layer of the module, which is \"hidden\" by the next module, but do not include the input layer, which is specified by the `atom_features` and `bond_features` arguments. We first provide the model with the atom features we selected above. (We do not pass `bond_features` in the example below as GraphSAGE only makes use of atom features.) Then, we configure the convolution module by specifying its overall architecture and size.\n",
