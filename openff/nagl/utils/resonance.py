    """
    Recursively attempts to find all resonance structures of an input molecule
    according to a modified version of the algorithm proposed by Gilson et al [1].

    Enumeration proceeds by:

    1. The molecule is turned into a ``networkx`` graph object.
    2. All hydrogen's and uncharged sp3 carbons are removed from the graph as these
    will not be involved in electron transfer.
    3. Disjoint sub-graphs are detected and separated out.
    4. Sub-graphs that don't contain at least 1 donor and 1 acceptor are discarded
    5. For each disjoint subgraph:
        a) The original v-charge algorithm is applied to yield the resonance structures
        of that subgraph.

    This will lead to ``M_i`` resonance structures for each of the ``N`` sub-graphs.

    If ``as_dicts=True`` then the resonance states in each sub-graph are returned. This
    avoids the need to combinatorially combining resonance information from each
    sub-graph. When ``as_dicts=False``, all ``M_0 x M_1 x ... x M_N`` forms are fully
    enumerated and return as molecule objects matching the input molecule type.

    .. note::

        * This method will strip all stereochemistry and aromaticity information from
        the input molecule.
        * The method only attempts to enumerate resonance forms that occur when a
        pair of electrons can be transferred along a conjugated path from a donor to
        an acceptor. Other types of resonance, e.g. different Kekule structures, are
        not enumerated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    molecule: openff.toolkit.topology.Molecule
        The molecule to enumerate resonance forms for.
    lowest_energy_only: bool, optional
        Whether to only return the resonance forms with the lowest
        'energy' as defined in [1].
    max_path_length: int, optional
        The maximum number of bonds between a donor and acceptor to
        consider. If None, all paths are considered.
    as_dicts: bool, optional
        Whether to return the resonance forms in a form that is more
        compatible with producing feature vectors. If false, all combinatorial
        resonance forms will be returned which may be significantly slow if the
        molecule is very heavily conjugated and has many donor / acceptor pairs.
    include_all_transfer_pathways: bool, optional
        Whether to include resonance forms that have
        the same formal charges but have different arrangements of bond orders. Such
        cases occur when there exists multiple electron transfer pathways between
        electron donor-acceptor pairs e.g. in cyclic systems.
